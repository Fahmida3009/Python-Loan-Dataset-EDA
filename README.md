## About the Project

The goal of this project is to explore the loan dataset, understand its structure, identify trends, and highlight key relationships between variables. EDA is a crucial step in understanding data and preparing for further analysis or predictive modeling.

---

## Key Insights

- gender and applicant income correlate with loan status.

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:
- **Applicant Details**: Gender, marital status, dependents, education, and self-employment status.
- **Loan Information**: Loan amount, loan term, and loan status (approved/rejected).
- **Financial Details**: Applicant's income, co-applicant's income, and credit history.

---

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries were used for the EDA:
- **Python**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `numpy` for numerical computations.

## Process

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Imported the dataset using `pandas` for analysis.
   
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values
  
   
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Performed descriptive statistics to summarize data.
   - Analyzed the distribution of numeric features
   - Explored relationships between categorical features

4. **Visualizations**:
   - **Bar Charts**: Loan status by gender.
   - **Heatmaps**: Correlation matrix for numeric features.
   - **Histograms**: Distribution of applicant incomes.
